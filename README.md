# Explore A Topic In VR
Explore some topics in VR in more depth using Unity and HMD. Demonstrate an interesting, creative, and substantial, contribution to VR software–new interaction techniques, interfaces, toolkit capabilities, and so forth.
- [Github repo](https://github.com/jordestay/vr) - this will probably be renamed at some point
- [Overleaf report](https://www.overleaf.com/project/63eef436e5d1a41b2f0436b9) - currently just the ACM template. Send your email on Discord and I'll add you to access the file.

## Brainstorm
- interaction menu (attatched to non-dominant hand, look to real-world examples)
	- watch-like informaiton menu
	- palm information menu (we look at our phones for info and the posture is to look at our open palm)
- cone casting with sliding scale for width of cone
- ant-man experience focused on changing the scale of the environment
- "become the object" travel, jump from object to object. The object you become changes how you interact with the environment
- 3d manipulation with two hands (Bimanual)
- data visualization in 3d (3d representation of a heatmap)
- scene-in-hand metaphor
- Gravity gun-esque manipulation tool
    - One-eyed scope? Leaves the other eye for viewing the larger context

## Milestones
### 1. Proposal + literature review (**3/17**)
- well-grounded, motivated, and creative project
- Access scientific sources free via the [USU library](https://library.usu.edu/), including peer-reviewed conferences such as IEEE VR, ACM ISMAR, ACM UIST, ACM CHI, or others, and journals such as ACM TOCHI and IEEE TVCG
- 6pg max report pdf with 8 references in ACM format
### 2. Prototype presentation (**4/6**)
- Implement & Write-up
### 3. Final Presentation (**4/20-25**)
- overview of your project’s motivation and implementation, project screen-cast, and lessons learned (7min)
	- what you did, how successful it was, what problems you faced, and so on
- questions (1min)
### 4. Final Demo + Final report (**4/27-5/3**)
- since we will be meeting in VR, it would be awesome if we could share the experience
- practice, prepare, clarify, organize, explain motivation
